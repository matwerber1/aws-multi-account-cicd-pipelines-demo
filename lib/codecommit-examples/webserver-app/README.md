This folder contains example code that you could push to CodeCommit to test the pipelines. 

You would first need to create a CodeCommit repository matching the name of the folder shown, then push the folder contents to the repository. 

If you create a repository with a different name, you may need to edit certain parameter/variable values in some of the pipeline deployment scripts.
